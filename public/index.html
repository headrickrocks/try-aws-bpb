      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

                <span style="font-family: Verdana, 'Lucida Grande', sans-serif;">In 2020, a year already disturbed with COVID-19 became even more disturbed by an odd fluxuation in stock price. GameStop, a company being shorted by the most prestigious Wall Street hedge funds, came to a screeching jump after an enourmous group of teenagers from Reddit invested their stock into the compnay. Reddit, a growing social media platform meant to connect groups of people with similarities, provided a means of communication for the teenagers to collaborate against the big investors shorting GameStop. Some hedge funds were down as much as 53% during this great jump in price. The big investments to make money against the hedge funds shorting GameStop is reffered to as a "Short Squeeze." Apps like Robinhood, investment apps that allow kids to put down money into stocks without any knowledge of how stock and the stock market, allow for these market disasters to occur. Eventually, GameStops stock came crashing down from about $300 to about $40. Tons of people lost money and tons of people made money. Thi odd story of GameStop's rising and crashing stock is one to remember.</span>
